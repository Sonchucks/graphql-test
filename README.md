# SpaceX Launch Details

A GraphQL practice project where I connect to the SpaceX launch details API and display the information through queries. Front end is setup using React and React Router.

## Getting Started
- `npm i` in both the root server folder and the client folder.
- `npm run dev` from root server folder to run both the server and client at the same time.
  - Server will be run on `localhost:5000`
  - Client will be run on `localhost:3000`
- To play around with the queries on the server, go to `localhost:5000/graphql`
